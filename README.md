Link Crawler
---------------------
The Python script **link_crawler.py** is a simple python crawler which crawls all the links present in a webpage. The user provides the **URL** of the page to be crawled for the links, in the **command line**. The code will print all the links present in the page.
I have taken guidance from udacity course for making and understanding the code. It is very useful for the beginners to understand the code.

- urllib2
- sys
